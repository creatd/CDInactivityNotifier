CDInactivityNotifier
====================

iOS component that is used to notify when there is a certain amount of inactivity (configurable for multiple different timeouts).

Note that this library uses an overlay above the root view to detect user interaction. It might conflict with other views/windows that are also inserted above root view. (In a typical application, you wouldn't insert any subviews above root view)

Use as you wish. For support or to discuss, use Github > issues.
